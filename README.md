Justification for TASK-1
Preservation of Categorical Information: The mode represents the most frequent category in a categorical column. By imputing missing values with the mode, we ensure that the imputed values are consistent with the existing data and preserve the categorical information in the column.                                                                                     Minimizing Data Loss: Dropping rows with missing categorical values can lead to a significant loss of data, especially when the number of missing values is relatively small. Imputation with the mode allows us to retain those rows in your dataset, ensuring that we make the most of the available data.                                                                             Maintaining Data Integrity: Imputing with the mode is a simple and straightforward method that doesn't introduce bias into the dataset. It doesn't alter the overall distribution of the categorical data and, therefore, doesn't impact the statistical properties of the column.
